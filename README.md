# Correct-by-Construction Type Checking

This repository contains a small example of a correct-by-construction type checker for the [simply-typed lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus) implemented in [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Setup

To get the code working, follow these steps:

1. Install Agda by following [the instruction on the website](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html).
2. Install the `standard-library` using the [installation guide](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/master/doc/installation-guide.md).
3. To test that everything works, compile the `ConstraintBasedTypeInference.agda` file.
